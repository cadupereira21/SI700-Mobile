# SI700-Mobile
In this repository, I developed an app for my father's store Seu Madeu Sucos, in which he makes and sells juices out of fresh fruits! The app is intended to help his users place orders and help him manage this orders! This is not a concluded project, since it was made during my mobile classes from university, therefore I only had one semester to do it.

The project was made using Flutter as the main framework, targeting Android and iOS devices! I used an Bloc pattern approach to handle my app's data and Firebase as my backend!
